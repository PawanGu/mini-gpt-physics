# MiniGPT for High School Physics

This project is a minimal transformer-based language model (MiniGPT) trained from scratch on a dataset of high school physics questions and answers.

## Features
- Built using PyTorch
- Tokenized with HuggingFace GPT-2 tokenizer
- Custom training loop and dataset loader
- Fine-tuned on 500+ physics Q&A pairs

## Usage

### Train the model
```bash
python train_mini_gpt.py
